a skilltree application

 **Goals:**

 get stronger with sql and rest in python and with python itself

**Development Plan: **

steps / ideas :
 step (0) = env setup pyenv, pycharm ide
 step (0a) - 

step (1) - (same) dockerize all the tihngs
 step (2) - (same) docker-compose script to spin up application
 step (3) - deploy, rollback ansible scripts to work on remote site

Step (1) - build a mock restful service in python - about where I'll probably abandon this project and pick something else to do;P
 Step (2) - build one working endpoint to display data on GET
 step (3a-3n) = finish restful service
 Step (4) - python + some orm 
 Step (5) - build out frontend forms and communication via rest (react) 
 \- where I'd consider minimally succesful as far as being an app
 step (6) - login / passport js
 step (7) - (super bonus) react-d3, or maybe just d3 in react - force directed graph display of skilltree
 step (11) - some kind of code lint thing like sonarqube

**Components:**

Frontend - react / nodejs using express 

Backend - python +
